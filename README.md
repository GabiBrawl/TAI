# TAI - Transparent Account Image
Have you ever tried to apply an image with transparent background as your account's profile picture, but windows decided to ruin the transparent background to black? I got ya! Just download and run this program with administrative privileges set your image through there, done! (You may need to restart the computer for changes to apply)
