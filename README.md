# TAI - Transparent Account Image
Have you ever tried using an image with a transparent background as your profile picture, only to have Windows turn it into a black background? Don't worry, I've got you covered! Just download this program, run it as an administrator, and set your image through the app. That's it! (A computer restart may be required for the changes to take effect.)
